## Introduction {.smaller}

-   Data collected from BoardGameGeek, largest online aggregator of board games in January 2022

    -   Records mechanics, player counts, ownership, playtime, average rating etc. for 8,000 games with min. 500+ reported copies owned

-   Two motivating questions:

    -   Does the range of total number of players supported tell us anything about a game's rating?

    -   Does the number of expansions a game has tell us anything about a game's sales (ownership)?

## Question 1: Player range and rating

```{r}
#| label: scatter-plot-question-1

comprehensive_plot1 <- comprehensive |>
  mutate(
    differential = maxplayers-minplayers
  ) |>
  filter(differential >= 0 & differential < 25) |>
  group_by(differential) |>
  mutate(
    average_rating = mean(average)
  )

  ggplot(comprehensive_plot1, aes(x=differential, y = average_rating)) +
    geom_jitter(
      colour = "gray",
      alpha = .5,
    aes(x=differential,
          y = average),
         show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_line(
      linetype = 2,
      colour = "#E84E93"
      ) +
    geom_point(
      colour = "red"
    ) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,25,5), minor_breaks = c(0:25)) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2,10,1), minor_breaks = seq(2,10,.5)) +

      x = "Range of Players Supported",
      y = "Rating",
      title = "There's little relationship between rating and player differential") +
    theme_minimal()
```

## Question 1: Ratings, by range

```{r}
#| label: heat-map-question-1

comprehensive_plot2 <- comprehensive |>
  filter(maxplayers <50)

p <- ggplot(comprehensive_plot2, aes(x = minplayers, y = maxplayers, fill = average)) +
  geom_tile(height = 1, width = 1) + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "red")+
  labs(title = "Games supporting more players are more highly rated", 
       x = "Minimum players", 
       y = "Maximum players", 
       fill = "Average Rating") + 
  guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 0.5, barheight = 8)) +

## Question 2: Expansions over time

## Question 2: Expansions v. Ownership

```{r}
#| label: boxplots-question-2


comprehensive_plot4 <- comprehensive |>
  #mutations to one variable done in multiple steps for code simplicity/ease of understanding
  mutate(expansions = str_count(boardgameexpansion, ',') + 1,
         expansions = replace_na(expansions, 0),
         expansions = if_else(expansions > 6, 7, expansions),
         expansions = as.character(expansions),
         expansions = str_replace(expansions, '7', '7+'))

#for data work: testing to see distribution of expansion count

#comprehensive_plot4 |>
  #group_by(expansions) |>
  #summarize(count = n()) |>
  #filter(count > 100)

  #geom_bar() +
  #scale_x_discrete(limits = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6")) +
  #geom_hline(yintercept = 100, color = "red")

comprehensive_plot4 |>
  ggplot(aes(x = expansions, y = owned)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Number of expansions", y = "Total copies owned", 
       title = "Games with more expansions tend to be more highly owned") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "log10", labels = scales::comma, breaks = c(1000, 2500, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000, 750000, 100000)) +
  theme_minimal()

## Limitations and Conclusions

-   People like games that support a wide range of players

-   On average, board game quality has gone up over time

-   Future revisions: Focus on subsets of board games
