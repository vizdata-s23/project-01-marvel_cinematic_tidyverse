We chose the Tidy Tuesday dataset, Board Games, published on January 25th, 2022. Originally collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jvanelteren/boardgamegeek-reviews?select=2022-01-08.csv), it combines board game descriptions and reviews from [Board Game Geek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/). Founded in 2000, Board Game Geek serves as an online community for board gaming hobbyists. They house a game database and have gained popularity and viewership from their annual Golden Geek Award, which medals the best new board game of the year. 

This data set stood out to us because we all share fond memories from playing board games but have never stopped to think about the industry as a whole and trends within it. The extensive collection of data was also alluring with its recent expansion of 4 million additional reviews in January of 2022. 

With `r ncol(comprehensive)`distinct characteristics and `r nrow(comprehensive)` board games, the data holds answers to a multitude of questions, but specifically, we are interested in using data visualizations to explore the relationships between variables such as number of players, rating, number of expansions, and game ownership.\

## Questions

Question 1: Do games with larger differentials in player counts (e.g. can support a wider range of players) tend to be more highly rated?

Question 2: How have the number of expansions for board games changed over time, and have they had an impact on game ownership count?

## Analysis plan

[For Question 1]{.underline}, we would like to explore whether the difference between the min players and max players of a board game are correlated with the ratings of that game. Does having more flexibility in the amount of players that can play a game lead to higher ratings?

\
In order to determine the relationship between the board game ratings and player differentials, we will first need to create a new variable **differential** which is calculated by subtracting the min_players from the max_players of a board game within a mutation function. The differential will then be plotted against the board game ratings as a geom_line graph with ratings on the y-axis and differential on the x-axis. We will then determine whether or not there is any relationship between the two values.

[For Question 2]{.underline}, we will first create a numerical variable num_expansions. This takes the number of unique entries in the boardgameexpansion variable and returns a count. Our next step is to create a simple mutation -- after grouping by yearpublished, we will see how many expansions were released per game published (num_expansions_per_game). We'll then visualize the relationship between yearpublished and num_expansions to represent the prevalence of this trend over time, using a line graph. (We'll also include the total number of games published as additional context, since we want to know how popular games are becoming overall.) 

\

The second part of our question can be answered by creating a second visualization. This time, we will group games by the num_expansions variable to see how their sales (represented by total ownership, or the owned variable) change. This will be a density plot with the year as the explanatory variable, different linetypes for the num_expansions, and density as a reflection of total sales.
